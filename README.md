# Portfolio-Project---CPU-Simulator

**Welcome to my CPU Simulator Project!**

Hey there! Welcome to my CPU simulator project where you can explore the inner workings of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) through an intuitive Python interface. With instructions like LOAD, STORE, ADD, and more, you can write and execute your own assembly-like programs. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting, this project offers an engaging experience to understand CPU architecture and programming concepts. Your feedback is highly valued, so feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions as we journey through this project together!
