# Portfolio-Project---CPU-Simulator

**Welcome to my CPU Simulator Project!**

Hey there! Welcome to my CPU simulator project where you can explore the inner workings of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) through an intuitive Python interface. With instructions like LOAD, STORE, ADD, and more, you can write and execute your own assembly-like programs. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting, this project offers an engaging experience to understand CPU architecture and programming concepts. Let's dive in and unravel the mysteries of the CPU together!
